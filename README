=== WHAT'S THIS ? 

This is a series of scripts developped for the 
article 'CPAN Patching with Git' that I wrote
for the Winter 2008 edition (aka issue 5.1) 
of the The Perl Review[1].  

The goal of those scripts is to make trivially
easy to grab any distribution off CPAN, gitify
its latest version, hack on it and send back
patches to the maintainer.  For now the only
documentation is in the article, but I'll 
eventually inject some documentation in
the scripts themselves (in the meantime, I
recommend to subscribe to the TPR :-) )

=== INSTALLATION

To install the scripts and their supporting module, do

    $ perl ./Build.PL
    $ ./Build test
    $ sudo ./Build install

or a variation thereof.

If you run Build.PL interactively, it'll also
ask you if you want to install the scripts alongside
the Git commands for a tighter integration (Git will
consider all the git-cpan-* commands as being legit
Git sub-command, which means that shell completion and
'git <blah>' type of commands will transparently work).
